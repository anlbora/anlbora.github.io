## HOME PAGE
The Home page provides an introduction to who I am and highlights key sections of the website.

  - **Welcome Section**: A brief welcome message and a summary of my roles and skills.

  - **Works and Blogs**: These sections showcase a preview of my projects and latest blog posts. Each entry is interactive and responsive to the cursor, featuring hover animations that enhance user experience.

  - **Header and Footer**: Both contain navigation elements with hover animations for a more engaging interface. The header includes links to other pages of the website, and the footer provides quick links to my social media profiles and an "up" button for easy navigation back to the top of the page.

## WORK PAGE
The Work page lists all of my projects, each with a brief description and a link to their GitHub repository or detailed view.

  - **Project Listings**: Each project is displayed with an image, title, and description. Clicking on a project will either redirect to the corresponding GitHub repository or, for non-GitHub projects like architectural work, open a detailed view in a new popup screen.
  - **Interactivity**: The project cards respond to cursor movement with hover animations, providing visual feedback and enhancing the browsing experience.

## BLOG PAGE
The Blog page features my latest blog posts and articles on various topics related to my interests and professional work.

  - **Blog Listings**: Each blog post is shown with a title, excerpt, and a link to read the full post. The posts are designed to be easily readable and engaging.

  - **File Upload**: An option to attach a file when sending a message.
  - **Footer Links**: Quick access to my email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and other social media profiles.

## THEMES and LANGUAGE
  - **Theme Switching**: The website supports both dark and light themes. Users can toggle between themes using a switch in the header, and their preference is remembered for future visits.
  - **Language Toggle**: Content can be switched between English and Turkish using the language toggle in the header. This feature is implemented using data attributes to dynamically change text content based on the selected language.

## SCRIPTS
JavaScript is used across the website to manage interactive elements, theme switching, and language toggling.

  - **scripts.js**: Each page has its own script file responsible for handling page-specific interactivity, such as smooth scrolling, toggling menus, and updating content dynamically.
